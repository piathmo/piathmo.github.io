    <p> I am currently a <strong>Junior</strong> at Mizzou with a major in <strong>Psychology</strong> and minor in <em>Black Studies</em>. I chose to go to Mizzou during my senior year of high school after touring the campus and loving it. I am from Kansas City, Missouri - just two hours away from Columbia. I wanted to go to a school far enough for me to be able to focus, but close enough to be able to come home anytime I needed a break. While I do love going to Mizzou, one thing I do wish I looked more into is some out of state schools. I got more into traveling after I graduated and there is definitely more to see than Missouri. I am also thinking of getting my masters degree in Industrial Psychology and getting into management or human resources. I decided to take this intro infortmation technology class because I wanted to see if I could simply just do it. I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and see if it was something I wanted to possibly get into. While this is dtill a learn as you go thing for me, I have definitely benefited a lot from taking this class and getting the exposure I wanted. I do believe life is about just getting out there and experiencing as much as you can, having fun with it, and challenging yourslef for the better. I hope you get to know more about me as you go through my website!</p>
    <h2 id="all-about-music-and-my-favorite-songs">All About Music and My Favorite Songs</h2>
    <p>I love music very much! I can truly say it is like therapy for me. The main genres I listen to are <strong>rap, hip hop, afrobeats, dancehall and r&amp;b</strong> (with some pop music occasionally)! Whether I&#39;m listening at a party or just when I am feeling bored, music always puts me in a better mood. I have been listening to music my whole life, however, when I was younger my older sibling were more in control and I would listen to what they would listen to. As I have grown though, I was able to find out what my likes and loves in music were and develop my own sense of what music is to me.</p>

    <h4 id="albums">Albums</h4>
    <p>I also have some albums that I feel like I can listen to through and through without getting tired of the songs. Another thing that I love are album covers! I love seeing how the artist basically chooses their own <em>folder</em> to hold all their songs. That one image reflects so much because it gets posted everywhere almost immediately and critiques by not only fans of that artist, but music execs, radio personalities, other artists, etc. I feel as though album covers really do just express so much, almost like an introduction to what you are going to hear. Below are the covers of each of those albums! </p>
